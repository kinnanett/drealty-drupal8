/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation to display a listing.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - drealty_listing: Full listing entity.
 *   - id: The listing ID.
 *   - bundle: The type of the listing.
 *   - authorid: The user ID of the listing author.
 *   - createdtime: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can
 *     reformat it by calling format_date() with the desired parameters on
 *     $variables['drealty_listing']->getCreatedTime().
 *   - featured: Whether the listing is featured to the front page.
 *   - published: Whether the listing is published.
 * - label: The title of the listing.
 * - content: All listing items. Use {{ content }} to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as {{ content.field_example }}. Use
 *   {{ content|without('field_example') %} to temporarily suppress the printing
 *   of a given child element.
 * - author_picture: The listing author user entity, rendered using the "compact"
 *   view mode.
 * - metadata: Metadata for this listing.
 * - date: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can reformat it by
 *   calling format_date() with the desired parameters on
 *   $variables['created'].
 * - author_name: Themed username of listing author output from theme_username().
 * - url: Direct URL of the current listing.
 * - attributes: HTML attributes for the containing element.
 *   The attributes.class element may contain one or more of the following
 *   classes:
 *   - drealty-listing: The current template type (also known as a "theming hook").
 *   - drealty-listing--[type]: The current listing type. For example, if the listing is a
 *     "Land" it would result in "drealty-listing--land". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - drealty-listing--view-mode-[view_mode]: The View Mode of the listing; for example, a
 *     teaser would result in: "drealty-listing--view-mode-teaser", and
 *     full: "drealty-listing--view-mode-full".
 *   - drealty-listing--preview: Whether a listing is in preview mode.
 *   The following are controlled through the listing publishing options.
 *   - drealty-listing--featured: Appears on featured listings.
 *   - drealty-listing--unpublished: Appears on unpublished listings visible only to site
 *     admins.
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - view_mode: View mode; for example, "teaser" or "full".
 * - teaser: Flag for the teaser state. Will be true if view_mode is 'teaser'.
 * - page: Flag for the full page state. Will be true if view_mode is 'full'.
 * - readmore: Flag for more state. Will be true if the teaser content of the
 *   listing cannot hold the main body content.
 * - is_front: Flag for front. Will be true when presented on the front page.
 * - logged_in: Flag for authenticated user status. Will be true when the
 *   current user is a logged-in member.
 * - is_admin: Flag for admin user status. Will be true when the current user
 *   is an administrator.
 *
 * In field variables, each field instance attached to the listing a corresponding
 * variable is defined; for example, 'drealty_listing.body' becomes 'body'. When needing to
 * access a field's raw values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to
 * use these variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the
 * desired field language; for example, 'drealty_listing.body.en', thus overriding any
 * language negotiation rule that may have been applied previously.
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_drealty_listing()
 *
 * @todo Remove the id attribute (or make it a class), because if that gets
 *   rendered twice on a page this is invalid CSS for example: two lists
 *   in different view modes.
 *
 * @ingroup themeable
